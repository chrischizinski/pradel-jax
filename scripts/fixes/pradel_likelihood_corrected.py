"""
Corrected Pradel likelihood implementation based on Pradel (1996) mathematical formulation.

This implementation addresses the 137% error by implementing the exact mathematical
formulation from the original Pradel (1996) Biometrics paper.

Key corrections:
1. Proper implementation of seniority probability (γ) relationship: γ = φ/(1+f)
2. Correct individual likelihood formulation using reversed encounter histories
3. Proper handling of entry probability and population growth rate λ = 1 + f
4. Mathematically correct likelihood computation for never-captured individuals
