# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS CHECKLIST
**Priority: CRITICAL | Timeline: Next 24-48 Hours**

## üö® STOP ALL PRODUCTION USE
- [ ] **Immediately cease** using Pradel-JAX for any analyses intended for publication
- [ ] **Flag existing results** as requiring validation
- [ ] **Document** which analyses may be affected by identified issues

## üìã FOR YOUR CURRENT REPORT

### Before Submission (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Include validation findings** in methodology section
- [ ] **Add disclaimer** about software limitations discovered
- [ ] **Document preprocessing fixes** implemented (gender/tier categorization)
- [ ] **Run sensitivity analysis** with multiple random seeds (3+ seeds minimum)
- [ ] **Check for red flags** in your results:
  - [ ] Identical log-likelihoods across different models
  - [ ] Parameter estimates exactly at boundaries (0.0 or 1.0)
  - [ ] Unrealistic survival/detection probabilities for your species
  - [ ] AIC differences <2 between clearly different models

### Validation Steps for Current Results
- [ ] **Re-run your key models** with the preprocessed Nebraska script
- [ ] **Compare results** before/after preprocessing fixes
- [ ] **Test convergence** with different starting seeds:
  ```bash
  python nebraska_sample_analysis.py --sample-size 1000 --max-models 10
  # Run 3 times with different random seeds, compare results
  ```
- [ ] **Document any changes** in parameter estimates after fixes

## üîß IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL FIXES

### Phase 1A: Critical Safety Measures (Today)
- [ ] **Implement parameter bounds checking**:
  ```python
  # Add to all model results
  if abs(survival_prob - 0.0) < 0.001 or abs(survival_prob - 1.0) < 0.001:
      WARN("Parameter at boundary - results may be unreliable")
  ```

- [ ] **Add log-likelihood uniqueness check**:
  ```python
  # Flag identical likelihoods
  if len(set(round(r.log_likelihood, 3) for r in results)) == 1:
      ERROR("All models have identical log-likelihoods - covariates not working")
  ```

- [ ] **Implement convergence validation**:
  ```python
  # Check gradient norms and parameter stability
  if convergence_diagnostics.gradient_norm > 0.1:
      WARN("Poor convergence - results may be unreliable")
  ```

### Phase 1B: Data Validation (Tomorrow)
- [ ] **Create data quality checker**:
  ```python
  def validate_data_quality(data):
      issues = []
      # Check for high missing percentages
      # Check for categorical variables coded as numbers  
      # Check for extreme outliers
      # Check for logical inconsistencies
      return issues
  ```

- [ ] **Add mandatory preprocessing validation**:
  ```python
  def preprocess_with_validation(data):
      # Document all transformations
      # Require user confirmation for major changes
      # Log all preprocessing steps
      return processed_data, transformation_log
  ```

## üìû COMMUNICATION PLAN

### Immediate Notifications (Today)
- [ ] **Notify collaborators** of validation issues discovered
- [ ] **Alert any co-authors** about potential impact on shared results
- [ ] **Document timeline** of when issues were discovered and addressed

### Stakeholder Communication
- [ ] **Prepare executive summary** of issues for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] **Draft communication** for any ongoing projects using this software
- [ ] **Plan disclosure** strategy for conferences/presentations

## üî¨ VALIDATION PROTOCOL FOR CURRENT WORK

### Quick Validation Steps
1. [ ] **Synthetic data test**:
   ```python
   # Create simple known-parameter dataset
   # Fit model, check if parameters recovered within 10%
   # If not, flag all results as highly uncertain
   ```

2. [ ] **Cross-validation check**:
   ```python
   # Split your data in half randomly
   # Fit same model to both halves
   # Parameter estimates should be similar
   ```

3. [ ] **Sensitivity analysis**:
   ```python
   # Remove 10% of data randomly
   # Refit models, check parameter stability
   # Large changes indicate fragile results
   ```

## üìÑ DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### For Current Report
- [ ] **Add methods section**: "Software validation and limitations"
- [ ] **Include supplementary material**: Validation test results
- [ ] **Document preprocessing**: All data transformations applied
- [ ] **Add confidence intervals**: Wider than software suggests (1.5x wider minimum)

### For Future Reference  
- [ ] **Create validation log**: All tests run and results
- [ ] **Document lessons learned**: Issues discovered and how fixed
- [ ] **Establish protocols**: For future software validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT FOR CURRENT RESULTS

### HIGH RISK (Likely Invalid)
- [ ] Any models with categorical covariates (gender, tier) **before** preprocessing fixes
- [ ] Models showing identical log-likelihoods across different covariate structures
- [ ] Parameter estimates at exact boundaries (0.0, 1.0)

### MEDIUM RISK (Requires Validation)
- [ ] Continuous covariate models without standardization
- [ ] Models with low sample sizes (<200 individuals)
- [ ] Complex models with multiple interactions

### LOW RISK (Probably OK)
- [ ] Intercept-only models on properly preprocessed data
- [ ] Simple models with well-preprocessed continuous covariates
- [ ] Models that pass all convergence diagnostics

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PROCEEDING

### Minimum Standards (Required)
- [ ] Parameter recovery within 10% on synthetic data
- [ ] No identical log-likelihoods for different models
- [ ] Convergence rate >80% on your datasets
- [ ] Results stable across random seeds (<5% variance)

### Preferred Standards (Ideal)
- [ ] Parameter recovery within 5% on synthetic data  
- [ ] Cross-validation against Program MARK results
- [ ] Comprehensive diagnostic reporting
- [ ] Automated result validation

## üìÖ TIMELINE

### Next 24 Hours (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Implement safety measures and data validation
- [ ] Re-run critical analyses with preprocessing fixes
- [ ] Document validation results for report

### Next 48 Hours (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Complete sensitivity analyses
- [ ] Prepare validation section for report
- [ ] Establish ongoing validation protocols

### Next Week (IMPORTANT)
- [ ] Begin comprehensive remediation plan implementation
- [ ] Engage with software development team
- [ ] Plan independent validation studies
