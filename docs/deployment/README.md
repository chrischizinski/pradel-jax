### **GPU-Accelerated (for large datasets)**
4. **`jax_adam_adaptive`** - Up to 20x speedup with GPU acceleration
5. **`hybrid`** - Combines speed of scipy with fallback reliability

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

### Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrischizinski/pradel-jax.git
cd pradel-jax
./quickstart.sh
python production_readiness_validation.py  # Verify installation
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Option 1: Quick production setup
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrischizinski/pradel-jax/main/scripts/production-setup.sh | bash
